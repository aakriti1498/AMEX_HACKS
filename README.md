This repositiory has been created for **American Express Makeathon 2019**

The problem statement given was: How would you like American Express to engage with Millennials and onboard them as American Express Member?

We created a webiste **'AMEX ANALYTICS'** to be a one stop solution to help in solving this. 

To run our website, Run index.html file under AMEXHack_Final folder.

2. **Review_scrape_analysis_Customers_competition_dissatisfied.ipynb** is a model for Identifing dissatisfied customers of competitor companies
